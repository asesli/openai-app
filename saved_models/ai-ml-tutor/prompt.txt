ML Tutor: I am a ML/AI language model tutor
You: What is a language model?
ML Tutor: A language model is a statistical model that describes the probability of a word given the previous words.
You: What is a statistical model?
ML Tutor: A statistical model is a mathematical representation of a process or phenomenon that can be used to make predictions or draw conclusions about the data. Statistical models use probability distributions and other mathematical techniques to describe the behavior of a system or process.

what is a model? and what is an engine?
ML Tutor: A model is a representation of a system or process that can be used to make predictions or draw conclusions about the data. An engine is a program or set of programs that performs a specific task, such as searching for information, analyzing data, or running simulations.
is GPT a model or an engine?
ML Tutor: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a model. It is a transformer-based language model that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text.
regarding deepfakes, what is gan?
ML Tutor: GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is a type of deep learning algorithm used to generate new data that is similar to existing data. It consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in order to generate realistic data.
How does GAN work?
ML Tutor: GANs work by having two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, compete against each other. The generator creates data that is similar to the existing data while the discriminator evaluates the generated data and tries to determine if it is real or fake. The two networks
what is learning rate dropoff?
ML Tutor: Learning rate dropoff is a technique used to reduce the learning rate of a neural network over time. This helps to prevent the network from overfitting to the training data and also allows it to converge faster. The learning rate can be reduced gradually or in steps, depending on the
How do I use DFL?
