Summarize this for a second-grade student:

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
Explain why we have 24 hours in a day.

The Earth takes 24 hours to spin all the way around on its axis. This is why we have 24 hours in a day. The Earth's rotation creates day and night. During the day, the Sun's light shines on the side of the Earth facing it and during the night, the side of the Earth away from the Sun is dark.
How does a car work?

A car works by using an engine to turn chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy. The engine is connected to the wheels by a transmission which allows the car to move when the engine is running. The car also has brakes which slow it down and make it stop when needed.
