##### Fix bugs in the below function
 
### Buggy Python
import Random
a = random.randint(1,12)
b = random.randint(1,12)
for i in range(10):
    question = "What is "+a+" x "+b+"? "
    answer = input(question)
    if answer = a*b
        print (Well done!)
    else:
        print("No.")
    
### Fixed Python
def read_yaml(filePath):
    with open(filePath, "r") as stream:
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(stream)
            return data
            #print()
        except yaml.YAMLError as exc:
            print(exc)a
    return []

def write_yaml(filePath, data):
    with open(filePath, "w") as stream:
        try:
            yaml.dump(data, stream)
        except yaml.YAMLError as exc:
            print(exc)

def main():
    filePath = "./data.yaml"
    data = read_yaml(filePath)
    print(data)
    data["new_key"] = "new_value"
    write_yaml(filePath, data)
    data = read_yaml(filePath)
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
